# Predicting-houses-price
Project Description:
This project aims to predict housing prices in California using various machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. The dataset used is the California Housing Dataset, which contains information on factors like average income, house age, and population per district.

The workflow involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, and handling missing values, followed by model training and evaluation. Several models are compared based on performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score. Hyperparameter tuning is also applied to optimize the performance of the models.

Through this project, we aim to determine the most effective model for predicting housing prices and explore how different machine learning techniques can impact the accuracy of predictions.
